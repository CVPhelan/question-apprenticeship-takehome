// The distance of the personâ€™s feet to the UFO is six rows, so unless you solve the codeword, you lose on the sixth incorrect guess.
// Every letter that was guessed but does not exist in the codeword is displayed and cannot be guessed again
// Every letter that was guessed that exists in the codeword replaces the dashes for all instances in which they exist in that word
// The game should identify whether a guess was correct or not
// The game should display the current state of abduction by the UFO.

// okay, scaffold your pseudo code, stupid
